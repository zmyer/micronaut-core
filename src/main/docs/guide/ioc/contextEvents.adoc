Micronaut supports a general event system through the context. The api:context.event.ApplicationEventPublisher[] API is used to publish events and the api:context.event.ApplicationEventListener[] API is used to listen to events. The event system is not limited to the events that Micronaut publishes and can be used for custom events created by the users.

=== Publishing Events

The api:context.event.ApplicationEventPublisher[] API supports events of any type, however all events that Micronaut publishes extend api:context.event.ApplicationEvent[].

To publish an event, obtain an instance of api:context.event.ApplicationEventPublisher[] either directly from the context or through dependency injection, and execute the `publishEvent` method with your event object.

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyBean {

    @Inject ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    void doSomething() {
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(...);
    }

}
----

WARNING: Publishing an event is *synchronous* by default! The `publishEvent` method will not return until all listeners have been executed. Move this work off to a thread pool if it is time intensive.

=== Listening for Events

To listen to an event, register a bean that implements api:context.event.ApplicationEventListener[] where the generic type is the type of event the listener should be executed for.

.Listening for Events with `ApplicationEventListener`
[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class DoOnStartup implements ApplicationEventListener<ServiceStartedEvent> {

    @Override
    void onApplicationEvent(ServiceStartedEvent event) {
        ...
    }
}
----

NOTE: The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/event/ApplicationEventListener.html#supports-E-[supports] method can be overridden to further clarify events that should be processed.

Alternatively you can use the ann:runtime.event.annotation.EventListener[] annotation if you do not wish to specifically implement an interface:

.Listening for Events with `@EventListener`
[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.runtime.event.annotation.EventListener;
...
@Singleton
public class DoOnStartup  {

    @EventListener
    void onStartup(ServiceStartedEvent event) {
        ...
    }
}
----

If your listener performs work that could take a while then you can use the ann:scheduling.annotation.Async[] annotation to run the operation on a separate thread:


.Asynchronously listening for Events with `@EventListener`
[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.runtime.event.annotation.EventListener;
import io.micronaut.scheduling.annotation.Async;

...
@Singleton
public class DoOnStartup  {

    @EventListener
    @Async
    void onStartup(ServiceStartedEvent event) {
        ...
    }
}
----

The event listener will by default run on the `scheduled` executor. You can configure this thread pool as required in `application.yml`:

.Configuring Scheduled Task Thread Pool
