Micronaut supports reactive and non-blocking client to connect to Postgres using https://github.com/reactiverse/reactive-pg-client[reactive-pg-client], allowing  to handle many database connections with a single thread.

== Configuring the Reactive Postgres Client
[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `postgres-reactive` feature to configure the Reactive Postgres client in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features postgres-reactive
----
====

To configure the Reactive Postgres client you should first add `postgres-reactive` module to your classpath:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-postgres-reactive"
----

You should then configure the URI or https://reactiverse.io/reactive-pg-client/apidocs/index.html[`PoolOptions`] of the Postgres server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
postgres:
	reactive:
	    client:
            port: 5432
            host: the-host
            database: the-db
            user: test
            password: test
            maxSize: 5
----

TIP: You can also connect to Postgres using `uri` instead of the other properties.

Once you have the above configuration in place then you can inject the `io.reactiverse.reactivex.pgclient.PgPool` bean. The following is the simplest way to connect:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/configuration/postgres/reactive/PostgresReactiveSpec.groovy[tags=query,indent=0]
----

<1> `client` is an instance of the `io.reactiverse.reactivex.pgclient.PgPool` bean.

For more information on running queries on Postgres using the reactive client please read the "Running queries" section in the documentation of https://reactiverse.io/reactive-pg-client/guide/groovy/index.html[reactive-pg-client].

== Postgres Health Checks

When the `postgres-reactive` module is activated a api:configuration.postgres.reactive.health.PgPoolHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] interface resolving the health of the Postgres connection.

The only configuration option supported is to enable or disable the indicator by the `endpoints.health.postgres.reactive.enabled` key.

See the section on the <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> for more information.
