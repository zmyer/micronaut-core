Validation advice is one of the most common advice types you are likely to want to incorporate into your application.

Validation advice is built on https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380[JSR 380], also known as Bean Validation 2.0.

JSR 380 is a specification of the Java API for bean validation which ensures that the
properties of a bean meet specific criteria, using `javax.validation` annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, and `@Max`.

http://hibernate.org/validator[Hibernate Validator] project is a reference implementation for JSR 380. Micronaut ships
with a built-in configuration to use Hibernate Validator.

To get started, first add the Hibernate Validator configuration to your application:

dependency:micronaut-hibernate-validator[groupId="io.micronaut.configuration"]

Then simply add the api:validation.Validated[] annotation to any class that requires validation. For example, consider this trivial service that retrieves books by title:

.BookService.java
[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/aop/validation/BookService.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/aop/validation/BookService.java[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The api:validation.Validated[] annotation is defined at the class level
<2> The `javax.validation.NotBlank` constraint is used to ensure parameters passed cannot be blank

You can verify the behaviour of the class by writing a test. The following test is written in Groovy and Spock:

.Testing Validation
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/aop/validation/BookServiceSpec.groovy[tags=test, indent=0]
