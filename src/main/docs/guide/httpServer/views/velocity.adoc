Micronaut includes api:views.velocity.VelocityViewsRenderer[] which uses
the http://velocity.apache.org[Apache Velocity] Java-based template engine.

In addition to the <<views, Views>> dependency, add the following dependency on your classpath. For example, in `build.gradle`

[source, groovy]
----
runtime "org.apache.velocity:velocity-engine-core:2.0"
----

The example shown in the <<views, Views>> section, could be rendered with the following Velocity template:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/home.vm
----
include::{testsviews}/../../../../resources/views/home.vm[]
----
