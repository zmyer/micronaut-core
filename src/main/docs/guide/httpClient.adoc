[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, the `http-client` dependency is included by default.
====

A critical component of any Microservice architecture is the client communication between Microservices. With that in mind Micronaut features a built in HTTP client that has both a low-level API and a higher level AOP-driven API.

TIP: Regardless whether you choose to use Micronaut's HTTP server, you may wish to use the Micronaut HTTP client in your application since it is a feature-rich client implementation.

To use the HTTP client you must have the `http-client` dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-http-client[]

Since the higher level API is built on the low-level HTTP client, we will first introduce the low-level client.
