To authenticate users you must provide implementations of link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/AuthenticationProvider.html[AuthenticationProvider].

The following code snippet illustrates a naive implementation:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/token/basicauth/AuthenticationProviderUserPassword.groovy[tag=clazz,indent=0]
----

The built-in <<login, Login Controller>> uses every available authentication provider. Authentication strategies, such as basic auth, where the credentials are present in the request use the available authentication providers too.


Micronaut ships with link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/DelegatingAuthenticationProvider.html[DelegatingAuthenticationProvider] which can be typically used
in environments such as the one described in the following diagram.

`DelegatingAuthenticationProvider` is not enabled unless you provide implementations for link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/UserFetcher.html[UserFetcher],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/PasswordEncoder.html[PasswordEncoder] and  link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/AuthoritiesFetcher.html[AuthoritiesFetcher]
