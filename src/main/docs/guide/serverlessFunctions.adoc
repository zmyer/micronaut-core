Server-less architectures where as a developer you deploy functions that are fully managed by the Cloud environment and are executed in ephemeral processes require a unique approach.

Traditional frameworks like Grails and Spring are not really suitable since low memory consumption and fast startup time are critical, since the Function as a Service (FaaS) server will typically spin up your function for a period using a cold start and then keep it warm.

Micronaut's compile-time approach, fast startup time and low-memory footprint make it a great candidate for using as a framework for developing functions and in fact Micronaut features dedicated support for developing and deploying functions to AWS Lambda and any FaaS system that supports running functions as containers (such as OpenFaaS, Rift or Fn).
