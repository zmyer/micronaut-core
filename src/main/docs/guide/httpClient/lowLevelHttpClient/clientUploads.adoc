The Micronaut HTTP Client supports the ability to create multipart requests. In order to build a multipart request you must set the content type to `multipart/form-data` and set the body to be an instance of api:io.micronaut.http.client.multipart.MultipartBody[]:

For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.client.upload.MultipartFileUploadSpec[tags="multipartBodyImports, file, multipartBody", indent=0, title="Creating the body"]

<1> You need to create a MultipartBody builder for adding parts to the body.
<2> Method to add a part to the body, in this case a file. There are different variations of this method which you can see in link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/client/multipart/MultipartBody.Builder.html[MultipartBody.Builder, window="_blank"].
<3> Call the build method to assemble all parts from the builder into a MultipartBody. At least one part is required.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.client.upload.MultipartFileUploadSpec[tags="request", indent=0, title="Creating a request"]

<1> The multipart request body with different sets of data.
<2> Set the content-type header of the request to `multipart/form-data`.
