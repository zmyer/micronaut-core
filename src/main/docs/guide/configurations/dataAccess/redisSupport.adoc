Micronaut features automatic configuration of the https://lettuce.io[Lettuce] driver for https://redis.io[Redis] via the `redis-lettuce` module.

== Configuring Lettuce
[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `redis-lettuce` feature to configure the Lettuce driver in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features redis-lettuce
----
====


To configure the Lettuce driver you should first add the `redis-lettuce` module to your classpath:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-redis-lettuce"
----

You should then configure the URI of the Redis server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

.Configuring `redis.uri`
[source,yaml]
----
redis:
    uri: redis://localhost
----

TIP: The `redis.uri` setting should be in the format as described in the https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details[Connection URIs] section of the Lettuce wiki

You can also specify multiple Redis URIs using `redis.uris` in which case a `RedisClusterClient` is created instead.

== Available Lettuce Beans

Once you have the above configuration in place you can inject one of the following beans:

* `io.lettuce.core.RedisClient` - The main client interface
* `io.lettuce.core.api.StatefulRedisConnection` - A connection interface that features synchronous, reactive (based on Reactor) and async APIs that operate on `String` values
* `io.lettuce.core.pubsub.StatefulRedisPubSubConnection` - A connection interface for dealing with Redis Pub/Sub

The following example demonstrates the use of the `StatefulRedisConnection` interface's synchronous API:

.Using StatefulRedisConnection
[source,groovy]
----
@Inject StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> connection
...
include::{testsredis}/RedisClientFactorySpec.groovy[tags=commands, indent=0]
----

NOTE: The Lettuce driver's `StatefulRedisConnection` interface is designed to be long-lived and there is no need to close the connection. It will be closed automatically when the application shuts down.

== Customizing The Redis Configuration

You can customize the Redis configuration using any properties exposed by the api:configuration.lettuce.DefaultRedisConfiguration[] class. For example, in `application.yml`:

.Customizing Redis Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
redis:
    uri: redis://localhost
    ssl: true
    timeout: 30s
----

=== Multiple Redis Connections

You can configure multiple Redis connections using the `redis.servers` setting. For example:

.Customizing Redis Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
redis:
    servers:
        foo:
            uri: redis://foo
        bar:
            uri: redis://bar
----

In which case the same beans will be created for each entry under `redis.servers` but exposed as `@Named` beans.

.Using StatefulRedisConnection
[source,groovy]
----
@Inject @Named("foo") StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> connection;
----

The above example will inject the connection named `foo`.

== Embedding Redis for Testing

You can run an embedded version of Redis for testing and CI scenarios by adding a dependency on the Embedded Redis project:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
testCompile "com.github.kstyrc:embedded-redis:0.6"
----

If Redis is unavailable for the configured Redis URI an embedded instance of Redis will be automatically be started and then shutdown at the end of the test (when `stop` is called on the `ApplicationContext`).

== Redis Health Checks

When the `redis-lettuce` module is activated a api:configuration.lettuce.health.RedisHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] interface resolving the health of the Redis connection or connections.

See the section on the <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> for more information.


== Using Redis as a Cache

You can use Redis as a cache implementation, see the section on <<caching, Cache Advice>> for how to configure Redis backed caches.

== Using Redis for HTTP Sessions

You can use Redis as a backing implementation for storing HTTP sessions. See the section on <<sessions, HTTP Sessions>> for more information on how to configure Redis backed sessions.
