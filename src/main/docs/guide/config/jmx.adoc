Micronaut currently has basic support for JMX. At this time, the support is *experimental* and subject to change. To get started, simply add a dependency on the configuration.

[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-jmx"
----

The configuration will create a bean for the management bean server based on configuration.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.configuration.jmx.JmxConfiguration.adoc[]

=== Endpoints

If the management dependency is also on the classpath, management beans will be created for all endpoints by default.
