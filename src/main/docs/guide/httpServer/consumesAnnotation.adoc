A Micronaut's controller action consumes `application/json` by default. Nonetheless, you can support other `Content-Type` with the `@Consumes` annotation.

<1> `@Consumes` annotation takes a `String[]` of supported media types for an incoming request.
<2> By default, a controller's action consumes request with `Content-Type` of type `application/json`.

=== Customizing Processed Content Types

Normally the JSON parsing only happens if the content type is `application/json`. The other api:io.micronaut.http.codec.MediaTypeCodec[] classes behave in a similar manner that they have pre-defined content types they can process. To extend the list of media types that a given codec should process, you can provide configuration that will be stored in api:io.micronaut.http.codec.CodecConfiguration[]:

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    codec:
        json:
            additionalTypes:
              - text/javascript
              - ...

Currently supported configuration prefixes are `json`, `json-stream`, `text`, and `text-stream`.
