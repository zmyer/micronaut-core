In distributed systems, failure happens and it is best to be prepared for it and handle it in as graceful a manner possible.

In addition, when developing Microservices it is quite common to work on a single Microservice without other Microservices the project requires being available.

With that in mind Micronaut features a native fallback mechanism that is integrated into <<retry, Retry Advice>> that allows falling back to another implementation in the case of failure.

Using the ann:retry.annotation.Fallback[] annotation you can declare a fallback implementation of a client that will be picked up and used once all possible retries have been exhausted.

In fact the mechanism is not strictly linked to Retry, you can declare any class as ann:retry.annotation.Recoverable[] and if a method call fails (or, in the case of reactive types, an error is emitted) a class annotated with `@Fallback` will be searched for.

To illustrate this consider again the `PetOperations` interface declared earlier. You can define a `PetFallback` class that will be called in the case of failure:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.annotation.retry.PetFallback[tags="class", indent=0, title="Defining a Fallback"]

TIP: If you purely want to use fallbacks to help with testing against external Microservices you can define fallbacks in the `src/test/java` directory so they are not included in production code.


As you can see the fallback does not perform any network operations and is quite simple, hence will provide a successful result in the case of an external system being down.

Of course, the actual behaviour of the fallback is down to you. You could for example implement a fallback that pulls data from a local cache when the real data is not available, and sends alert emails to operations about downtime or whatever.
