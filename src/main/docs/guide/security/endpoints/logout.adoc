You can enable `LogoutController` with configuration property:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.endpoints.LogoutControllerConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

Each bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/handlers/LogoutHandler.html[LogoutHandler] gets invoked.

TIP: If you are using JWT authentication, you may not need to invoke the `/logout` endpoint. Since logging out normally means simply deleting access, refresh JWT tokens at the client side.

== Logout Endpoint invocation example

[source, bash]
