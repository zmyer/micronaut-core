Out-of-the-box, Micronaut supports https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[RFC7617] which defines the "Basic" Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) authentication scheme, which transmits credentials as user-id/password pairs, encoded using Base64.

Once you enable Micronaut security, Basic Auth is enabled by default.

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/token/basicauth/BasicAuthSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

The following sequence illustrates the authentication flow:

Below is a sample of a cURL command using basic auth:

[source, bash]
.cURL command using Basic Auth
----
curl "http://localhost:8080/info" \
     -u 'user:password'
----

After credentials are read from the HTTP Header, they are feed into an link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/Authenticator.html[Authenticator]
which attempts to validate them.

The following configuration properties are available to customize basic authentication behaviour:
